# Batman, Watchmen

> Rorschach: We were meant to exact justice. Everyone's going to know what you've done.
> Ozymandias: Will they? By exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today
> Nite Owl: Peace based on a lie
> Ozymandias: But peace nonetheless
> Dr Manhattan: He's right. Exposing Adrien would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
> Silk Spectre: No, we can't do this.
> Dr Manhattan: On mars, you taught me the value of life. If we hope to preserve it here, we must remain silent.
> Rorschach: Keep your own secrets
> *Rorschach leaves*

> Rorschach: Out of my way. People have to be told.
> Dr Manhattan: You know I can't let you do that
> Rorschach: Suddenly you discover humanity? Convenient
> *Rorschach takes off his mask*
> Rorschach: If you'd cared from the start, none of this would have happened
> Dr Manhattan: I can change almost anything, but I can't change human nature
> Rorschach: Of course you must protect _'s new Utopia. What's one more body amongst foundations?
> Rorschach: Well, what are you waiting for? Do it
> Rorschach: Do it!
*Dr Manhatten waves his hand, Rorshach explodes*

- from the 2009 film Watchmen, based on the 1986â€“1987 DC Comics series of the same name

Like at the end of The Dark Knight, sometimes the truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more, sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded, "You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villain.". And Alfred burns the letter from Rachel saying "Dear Bruce. I need to be honest and clear. I'm going to marry Harvey Dent. I love him, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman we could be together, I meant it. But now I'm sure the day won't come when *you* no longer need Batman. I hope it does; and if it does I will be there, but as your friend. I'm sorry to let you down. If you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people. Love, now and always, Rachel." I think they could have spun Harvey Dent's situation, but I'm 100% with Alfred burning that letter.
