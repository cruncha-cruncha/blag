# Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes

Aka: when a measure becomes a metric, it ceases to be a good measure.

But also, some metrics are bad from the get-go:

- LOC is really easy to game

- Often refactoring to make things faster or cleaner (both really good things) will remove lines of code. Bill Atkinson removed 2000 lines of code from Apple Lisa.
