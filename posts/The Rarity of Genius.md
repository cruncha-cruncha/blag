# On the Rarity of Genius

"either exceptional creative ability is almost impossibly rare, or greatness is more common than we realize and the rarity is recognition." - from [https://www.chrbutler.com/you-can-be-a-great-designer-and-be-completely-unknown](https://www.chrbutler.com/you-can-be-a-great-designer-and-be-completely-unknown), aka Christopher Butler

The same could be said for almost any field. Maybe this is the source of so much social media; we all have the idea that we are geniuses and are seeking recognition for it. And we are all actual geniuses.
