Beautiful, simple (in terms of required frontend technology) visualization. This guy used to work at spotify, and the website relied on internal tools he had access to? Then he got laid off. Lovely calming words to help deal with the loss though:
- "Chapters sometimes close abruptly and not all of the pages survive. we pause in memory and then go again in search of new songs."
- "Be calmly aware that this may periodically expand, contract or combust."
