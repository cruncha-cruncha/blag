# [Tommie Smith (gold medal) and John Carlos (bronze medal) both held their black-gloved fists in the air, while standing on the olympic podium as the the Star-Spangled banner played. Both athletes planned to wear a black glove on their right hand at the ceremony, but Carlos forgot his pair, so wore Smith's left instead. In many pictures, their heads are lowered. In contemplation? In gratitude? In prayer? Out of respect for the larger gesture at hand, as if to say that this is larger than I am and by lowering my face I am minimizing self pride from the action to emphasize a greater whole?](https://duckduckgo.com/?iar=images&q=1968%20olympic%20games%20black%20power%20salute)
