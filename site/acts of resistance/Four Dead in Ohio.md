# Four Dead in Ohio

> Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
> We're finally on our own
> This summer I hear the drumming
> Four dead in Ohio
> Gotta get down to it, soldiers are cutting us down
> Should have been gone long ago
> What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
> How can you run when you know?

Excerpt from the lyrics of "Ohio", a song written and performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young. It was in part a response to the Kent State shootings; on May 4th 1970, at the Kent State University campus in the United States, the Ohio National Guard opened fire (with live rounds) on unarmed college students who were protesting the Vietnam War. The song was first recorded on May 21, 1970.
